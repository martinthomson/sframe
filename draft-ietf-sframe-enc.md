--- abstract

This document describes the Secure Frame (SFrame) end-to-end encryption and
authentication mechanism for media frames in a multiparty conference call, in
which central media servers (selective forwarding units or SFUs) can access the
media metadata needed to make forwarding decisions without having access to the
actual media.

The proposed mechanism differs from the Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP) in that
it is independent of RTP (thus compatible with non-RTP media transport) and can
be applied to whole media frames in order to be more bandwidth efficient.

# Introduction

Modern multi-party video call systems use Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
servers to efficiently route media streams to call endpoints based on factors such
as available bandwidth, desired video size, codec support, and other factors. An
SFU typically does not need access to the media content of the conference,
allowing for the media to be "end-to-end" encrypted so that it cannot be
decrypted by the SFU. In order for the SFU to work properly, though, it usually
needs to be able to access RTP metadata and RTCP feedback messages, which is not
possible if all RTP/RTCP traffic is end-to-end encrypted.

As such, two layers of encryption and authentication are required:

  1. Hop-by-hop (HBH) encryption of media, metadata, and feedback messages
     between the the endpoints and SFU
  2. End-to-end (E2E) encryption (E2EE) of media between the endpoints

The Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP) is already widely used for HBH encryption
{{?RFC3711}}. The SRTP "double encryption" scheme defines a way to do E2E
encryption in SRTP {{?RFC8723}}. Unfortunately, this scheme has poor efficiency
and high complexity, and its entanglement with RTP makes it unworkable in
several realistic SFU scenarios.

This document proposes a new E2EE protection scheme known as SFrame,
specifically designed to work in group conference calls with SFUs. SFrame is a
general encryption framing that can be used to protect media payloads, agnostic
of transport.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

MAC:
: Message Authentication Code

E2EE:
: End to End Encryption

HBH:
: Hop By Hop

We use "Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)" and "media stream" in a less formal sense
than in {{?RFC7656}}.  An SFU is a selective switching function for media
payloads, and a media stream a sequence of media payloads, in both cases
regardless of whether those media payloads are transported over RTP or some
other protocol.

# Goals

SFrame is designed to be a suitable E2EE protection scheme for conference call
media in a broad range of scenarios, as outlined by the following goals:

1. Provide a secure E2EE mechanism for audio and video in conference calls
   that can be used with arbitrary SFU servers.

2. Decouple media encryption from key management to allow SFrame to be used
   with an arbitrary key management system.

3. Minimize packet expansion to allow successful conferencing in as many
   network conditions as possible.

4. Independence from the underlying transport, including use in non-RTP
   transports, e.g., WebTransport {{?I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview}}.

5. When used with RTP and its associated error resilience mechanisms, i.e., RTX
   and FEC, require no special handling for RTX and FEC packets.

6. Minimize the changes needed in SFU servers.

7. Minimize the changes needed in endpoints.

8. Work with the most popular audio and video codecs used in conferencing
   scenarios.

# SFrame

This document defines an encryption mechanism that provides effective E2EE,
is simple to implement, has no dependencies on RTP, and minimizes
encryption bandwidth overhead. This section describes how the mechanism
works, including details of how applications utilize SFrame for media protection,
as well as the actual mechanics of E2EE for protecting media.

## Application Context

SFrame is a general encryption framing, intended to be used as an E2EE
layer over an underlying HBH-encrypted transport such as SRTP or QUIC
{{RFC3711}}{{?I-D.ietf-moq-transport}}.

The scale at which SFrame encryption is applied to media determines the overall
amount of overhead that SFrame adds to the media stream, as well as the
engineering complexity involved in integrating SFrame into a particular
environment. Two patterns are common: Either using SFrame to encrypt whole
media frames (per-frame) or individual transport-level media payloads
(per-packet).

For example, {{media-stack}} shows a typical media sender stack that takes media
from some source, encodes it into frames, divides those frames into media
packets, and then sends those payloads in SRTP packets. The receiver stack
performs the reverse operations, reassembling frames from SRTP packets and
decoding.  Arrows indicate two different ways that SFrame protection could be
integrated into this media stack, to encrypt whole frames or individual media
packets.

Applying SFrame per-frame in this system offers higher efficiency, but may
require a more complex integration in environments where depacketization relies
on the content of media packets. Applying SFrame per-packet avoids this
complexity, at the cost of higher bandwidth consumption.  Some quantitative
discussion of these trade-offs is provided in {{overhead-analysis}}.

As noted above, however, SFrame is a general media encapsulation, and can be
applied in other scenarios.  The important thing is that the sender and
receivers of an SFrame-encrypted object agree on that object's semantics.
SFrame does not provide this agreement; it must be arranged by the application.

Like SRTP, SFrame does not define how the keys used for SFrame are exchanged by
the parties in the conference.  Keys for SFrame might be distributed over an
existing E2E-secure channel (see {{sender-keys}}), or derived from an E2E-secure
shared secret (see {{mls}}).  The key management system MUST ensure that each
key used for encrypting media is used by exactly one media sender, in order to
avoid reuse of nonces.

## SFrame Ciphertext

An SFrame ciphertext comprises an SFrame header followed by the output of an
AEAD encryption of the plaintext {{!RFC5116}}, with the header provided as additional
authenticated data (AAD).

The SFrame header is a variable-length structure described in detail in
{{sframe-header}}.  The structure of the encrypted data and authentication tag
are determined by the AEAD algorithm in use.

~~~~~

When SFrame is applied per-packet, the payload of each packet will be an SFrame
ciphertext.  When SFrame is applied per-frame, the SFrame ciphertext
representing an encrypted frame will span several packets, with the header
appearing in the first packet and the authentication tag in the last packet.
It is the responsibility of the application to reassemble an encrypted frame from
individual packets, accounting for packet loss and reordering as necessary.

## SFrame Header

The SFrame header specifies two values from which encryption parameters are
derived:

* A Key ID (KID) that determines which encryption key should be used
* A counter (CTR) that is used to construct the nonce for the encryption

Applications MUST ensure that each (KID, CTR) combination is used for exactly
one SFrame encryption operation. A typical approach to achieving this guarantee is
outlined in {{header-value-uniqueness}}.

~~~~~
{: #fig-sframe-header title="SFrame header"}

The SFrame Header has the overall structure shown in {{fig-sframe-header}}.  The
first byte is a "config byte", with the following fields:

Extended Key Id Flag (X, 1 bit):
: Indicates if the K field contains the key id or the Key ID length.

Key or Key Length (K, 3 bits):
: This field contains the Key ID (KID) if the X flag is set to 0, or the key id
length, minus one, if set to 1.

Extended Counter Flag (Y, 1 bit):
: Indicates if the C field contains the counter or the counter length.

Counter or Counter Length (C, 3 bits):
: This field contains the counter (CTR) if the Y flag is set to 0, or the counter
length, minus one, if set to 1.

The Key ID and Counter fields are encoded as compact unsigned integers in
network (big-endian) byte order.  If the value of one of these fields is in the
range 0-7, then the value is carried in the corresponding bits of the config
byte (K or C) and the corresponding flag (X or Y) is set to zero.  Otherwise,
the value MUST be encoded with the minimum number of bytes required and
appended after the configuration byte, with the Key ID first and Counter second.
The header field (K or C) is set to the number of bytes in the encoded value,
minus one.  The value 000 represents a length of 1, 001 a length of 2, etc.
This allows a 3-bit length field to represent the value lengths 1-8.

The SFrame header can thus take one of the four forms shown in
{{fig-sframe-header-cases}}, depending on which of the X and Y flags are set.

## Encryption Schema

SFrame encryption uses an AEAD encryption algorithm and hash function defined by
the cipher suite in use (see {{cipher-suites}}).  We will refer to the following
aspects of the AEAD algorithm below:

* `AEAD.Encrypt` and `AEAD.Decrypt` - The encryption and decryption functions
  for the AEAD.  We follow the convention of RFC 5116 {{!RFC5116}} and consider
  the authentication tag part of the ciphertext produced by `AEAD.Encrypt` (as
  opposed to a separate field as in SRTP {{?RFC3711}}).

* `AEAD.Nk` - The size in bytes of a key for the encryption algorithm

* `AEAD.Nn` - The size in bytes of a nonce for the encryption algorithm

* `AEAD.Nt` - The overhead in bytes of the encryption algorithm (typically the
  size of a "tag" that is added to the plaintext)

### Key Selection

Each SFrame encryption or decryption operation is premised on a single secret
`base_key`, which is labeled with an integer KID value signaled in the SFrame
header.

The sender and receivers need to agree on which key should be used for a given
KID.  Moreover, senders and receivers need to agree on whether keys will be used
for encryption or decryption only. The process for provisioning keys and their KID
values is beyond the scope of this specification, but its security properties will
bound the assurances that SFrame provides.  For example, if SFrame is used to
provide E2E security against intermediary media nodes, then SFrame keys need to
be negotiated in a way that does not make them accessible to these intermediaries.

For each known KID value, the client stores the corresponding symmetric key
`base_key`.  For keys that can be used for encryption, the client also stores
the next counter value CTR to be used when encrypting (initially 0).

When encrypting a plaintext, the application specifies which KID is to be used,
and the counter is incremented after successful encryption.  When decrypting,
the `base_key` for decryption is selected from the available keys using the KID
value in the SFrame Header.

A given key MUST NOT be used for encryption by multiple senders.  Such reuse
would result in multiple encrypted frames being generated with the same (key,
nonce) pair, which harms the protections provided by many AEAD algorithms.
Implementations SHOULD mark each key as usable for encryption or decryption,
never both.

Note that the set of available keys might change over the lifetime of a
real-time session.  In such cases, the client will need to manage key usage to
avoid media loss due to a key being used to encrypt before all receivers are
able to use it to decrypt.  For example, an application may make decryption-only
keys available immediately, but delay the use of keys for encryption until (a)
all receivers have acknowledged receipt of the new key or (b) a timeout expires.

### Key Derivation

SFrame encrytion and decryption use a key and salt derived from the `base_key`
associated to a KID.  Given a `base_key` value, the key and salt are derived
using HKDF {{!RFC5869}} as follows:

~~~~~
def derive_key_salt(KID, base_key):
  sframe_secret = HKDF-Extract("", base_key)

  sframe_key_label = "SFrame 1.0 Secret key " + KID + cipher_suite
  sframe_key = HKDF-Expand(sframe_secret, info, AEAD.Nk)

  sframe_salt_label = "SFrame 1.0 Secret salt " + KID + cipher_suite
  sframe_salt = HKDF-Expand(sframe_secret, info, AEAD.Nn)

  return sframe_key, sframe_salt
~~~~~

In the derivation of `sframe_secret`:

* The `+` operator represents concatenation of byte strings.

* The KID value is encoded as an 8-byte big-endian integer, not the compressed
  form used in the SFrame header.

* The `cipher_suite` value is a 2-byte big-endian integer representing the
  cipher suite in use (see {{sframe-cipher-suites}}).

The hash function used for HKDF is determined by the cipher suite in use.

### Encryption

SFrame encryption uses the AEAD encryption algorithm for the cipher suite in use.
The key for the encryption is the `sframe_key` and the nonce is formed by XORing
the `sframe_salt` with the current counter, encoded as a big-endian integer of
length `AEAD.Nn`.

The encryptor forms an SFrame header using the CTR, and KID values provided.
The encoded header is provided as AAD to the AEAD encryption operation, together
with application-provided metadata about the encrypted media (see {{metadata}}).

~~~~~
def encrypt(CTR, KID, metadata, plaintext):
  sframe_key, sframe_salt = key_store[KID]

  ctr = encode_big_endian(CTR, AEAD.Nn)
  nonce = xor(sframe_salt, CTR)

  header = encode_sframe_header(CTR, KID)
  aad = header + metadata

  ciphertext = AEAD.Encrypt(sframe_key, nonce, aad, plaintext)
  return header + ciphertext
~~~~~

For example, the metadata input to encryption allows for frame metadata to be
authenticated when SFrame is applied per-frame.  After encoding the frame and
before packetizing it, the necessary media metadata will be moved out of the
encoded frame buffer, to be sent in some channel visible to the SFU (e.g., an
RTP header extension).

### Decryption

Before decrypting, a receiver needs to assemble a full SFrame ciphertext. When
an SFrame ciphertext may be fragmented into multiple parts for transport (e.g.,
a whole encrypted frame sent in multiple SRTP packets), the receiving client
collects all the fragments of the ciphertext, using an appropriate sequencing
and start/end markers in the transport. Once all of the required fragments are
available, the client reassembles them into the SFrame ciphertext, then passes
the ciphertext to SFrame for decryption.

The KID field in the SFrame header is used to find the right key and salt for
the encrypted frame, and the CTR field is used to construct the nonce. The SFrame
decryption procedure is as follows:

~~~~~
def decrypt(metadata, sframe_ciphertext):
  KID, CTR, header, ciphertext = parse_ciphertext(sframe_ciphertext)

  sframe_key, sframe_salt = key_store[KID]

  ctr = encode_big_endian(CTR, AEAD.Nn)
  nonce = xor(sframe_salt, ctr)
  aad = header + metadata

  return AEAD.Decrypt(sframe_key, nonce, aad, ciphertext)
~~~~~

If a ciphertext fails to decrypt because there is no key available for the KID
in the SFrame header, the client MAY buffer the ciphertext and retry decryption
once a key with that KID is received.  If a ciphertext fails to decrypt for any
other reason, the client MUST discard the ciphertext. Invalid ciphertexts SHOULD be
discarded in a way that is indistinguishable (to an external observer) from having
processed a valid ciphertext.

## Cipher Suites

Each SFrame session uses a single cipher suite that specifies the following
primitives:

* A hash function used for key derivation

* An AEAD encryption algorithm [RFC5116] used for frame encryption, optionally
  with a truncated authentication tag

This document defines the following cipher suites, with the constants defined in
{{encryption-schema}}:

| Name                          | Nh | Nk | Nn | Nt |
|:------------------------------|:---|----|:---|:---|
| `AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_80`  | 32 | 48 | 12 | 10 |
| `AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_64`  | 32 | 48 | 12 |  8 |
| `AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_32`  | 32 | 48 | 12 |  4 |
| `AES_128_GCM_SHA256_128`      | 32 | 16 | 12 | 16 |
| `AES_256_GCM_SHA512_128`      | 64 | 32 | 12 | 16 |
{: #cipher-suite-constants title="SFrame cipher suite constants" }

Numeric identifiers for these cipher suites are defined in the IANA registry
created in {{sframe-cipher-suites}}.

In the suite names, the length of the authentication tag is indicated by
the last value: "\_128" indicates a hundred-twenty-eight-bit tag, "\_80" indicates
a eighty-bit tag, "\_64" indicates a sixty-four-bit tag and "\_32" indicates a
thirty-two-bit tag.

In a session that uses multiple media streams, different cipher suites might be
configured for different media streams.  For example, in order to conserve
bandwidth, a session might use a cipher suite with eighty-bit tags for video frames
and another cipher suite with thirty-two-bit tags for audio frames.

### AES-CTR with SHA2

In order to allow very short tag sizes, we define a synthetic AEAD function
using the authenticated counter mode of AES together with HMAC for
authentication.  We use an encrypt-then-MAC approach, as in SRTP {{?RFC3711}}.

Before encryption or decryption, encryption and authentication subkeys are
derived from the single AEAD key.  The overall length of the AEAD key is `Nka +
Nh`, where `Nka` represents the key size for the AES block cipher in use and `Nh`
represents the output size of the hash function  (as in {{iana-cipher-suites}}).
The encryption subkey comprises the first `Nka` bytes and the authentication
subkey comprises the remaining `Nh` bytes.

~~~~~
def derive_subkeys(sframe_key):
  enc_key = sframe_key[..Nka]
  auth_key = sframe_key[Nka..]
  return enc_key, auth_key
~~~~~

The AEAD encryption and decryption functions are then composed of individual
calls to the CTR encrypt function and HMAC.  The resulting MAC value is truncated
to a number of bytes `Nt` fixed by the cipher suite.

~~~~~
def truncate(tag, n):
  # Take the first `n` bytes of `tag`
  return tag[..n]

def compute_tag(auth_key, nonce, aad, ct):
  aad_len = encode_big_endian(len(aad), 8)
  ct_len = encode_big_endian(len(ct), 8)
  tag_len = encode_big_endian(Nt, 8)
  auth_data = aad_len + ct_len + tag_len + nonce + aad + ct
  tag = HMAC(auth_key, auth_data)
  return truncate(tag, Nt)

def AEAD.Encrypt(key, nonce, aad, pt):
  enc_key, auth_key = derive_subkeys(key)
  initial_counter = nonce + 0x00000000 # append four zero bytes
  ct = AES-CTR.Encrypt(enc_key, initial_counter, pt)
  tag = compute_tag(auth_key, nonce, aad, ct)
  return ct + tag

def AEAD.Decrypt(key, nonce, aad, ct):
  inner_ct, tag = split_ct(ct, tag_len)

  enc_key, auth_key = derive_subkeys(key)
  candidate_tag = compute_tag(auth_key, nonce, aad, inner_ct)
  if !constant_time_equal(tag, candidate_tag):
    raise Exception("Authentication Failure")

  initial_counter = nonce + 0x00000000 # append four zero bytes
  return AES-CTR.Decrypt(enc_key, initial_counter, inner_ct)
~~~~~

# Key Management

SFrame must be integrated with an E2E key management framework to exchange and
rotate the keys used for SFrame encryption. The key management
framework provides the following functions:

* Provisioning KID / `base_key` mappings to participating clients
* Updating the above data as clients join or leave

It is the responsibility of the application to provide the key management
framework, as described in {{key-management-framework}}.

## Sender Keys

If the participants in a call have a pre-existing E2E-secure channel, they can
use it to distribute SFrame keys.  Each client participating in a call generates
a fresh `base_key` value that it will use to encrypt media. The client then uses
the E2E-secure channel to send their encryption key to the other participants.

In this scheme, it is assumed that receivers have a signal outside of SFrame for
which client has sent a given frame (e.g., an RTP SSRC).  SFrame KID
values are then used to distinguish between versions of the sender's `base_key`.

Key IDs in this scheme have two parts, a "key generation" and a "ratchet step".
Both are unsigned integers that begin at zero.  The key generation increments
each time the sender distributes a new key to receivers.  The "ratchet step" is
incremented each time the sender ratchets their key forward for forward secrecy:

~~~~~ pseudocode
base_key[i+1] = HKDF-Expand(
                  HKDF-Extract("", base_key[i]),
                  "SFrame 1.0 Ratchet", CipherSuite.Nh)
~~~~~

For compactness, we do not send the whole ratchet step.  Instead, we send only
its low-order `R` bits, where `R` is a value set by the application.  Different
senders may use different values of `R`, but each receiver of a given sender
needs to know what value of `R` is used by the sender so that they can recognize
when they need to ratchet (vs. expecting a new key).  `R` effectively defines a
re-ordering window, since no more than 2<sup>`R`</sup> ratchet steps can be
active at a given time.  The key generation is sent in the remaining `64 - R`
bits of the key ID.

~~~~~ pseudocode
KID = (key_generation << R) + (ratchet_step % (1 << R))
~~~~~

~~~ aasvg
     64-R bits         R bits
 <---------------> <------------>
+-----------------+--------------+
| Key Generation  | Ratchet Step |
+-----------------+--------------+
~~~
{: #sender-keys-kid title="Structure of a KID in the Sender Keys scheme" }

The sender signals such a ratchet step update by sending with a KID value in
which the ratchet step has been incremented.  A receiver who receives from a
sender with a new KID computes the new key as above.  The old key may be kept
for some time to allow for out-of-order delivery, but should be deleted
promptly.

If a new participant joins in the middle of a session, they will need to receive
from each sender (a) the current sender key for that sender and (b) the current
KID value for the sender. Evicting a participant requires each sender to send
a fresh sender key to all receivers.

It is up to the application to decide when sender keys are updated.  A sender
key may be updated by sending a new `base_key` (updating the key generation) or
by hashing the current `base_key` (updating the ratchet step).  Ratcheting the
key forward is useful when adding new receivers to an SFrame-based interaction,
since it assures that the new receivers can't decrypt any media encrypted before
they were added.  If a sender wishes to assure the opposite property when
removing a receiver (i.e., ensuring that the receiver can't decrypt media after
they are removed), then the sender will need to distribute a new sender key.

## MLS

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides group authenticated key
exchange {{?I-D.ietf-mls-architecture}} {{?I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}}.  In
principle, it could be used to instantiate the sender key scheme above, but it
can also be used more efficiently directly.

MLS creates a linear sequence of keys, each of which is shared among the members
of a group at a given point in time.  When a member joins or leaves the group, a
new key is produced that is known only to the augmented or reduced group.  Each
step in the lifetime of the group is know as an "epoch", and each member of the
group is assigned an "index" that is constant for the time they are in the
group.

To generate keys and nonces for SFrame, we use the MLS exporter function to
generate a `base_key` value for each MLS epoch.  Each member of the group is
assigned a set of KID values, so that each member has a unique `sframe_key` and
`sframe_salt` that it uses to encrypt with.  Senders may choose any KID value
within their assigned set of KID values, e.g., to allow a single sender to send
multiple uncoordinated outbound media streams.

~~~~~ pseudocode
base_key = MLS-Exporter("SFrame 1.0 Base Key", "", AEAD.Nk)
~~~~~

For compactness, we do not send the whole epoch number.  Instead, we send only
its low-order `E` bits, where `E` is a value set by the application.  `E`
effectively defines a re-ordering window, since no more than 2<sup>`E`</sup>
epochs can be active at a given time.  Receivers MUST be prepared for the epoch
counter to roll over, removing an old epoch when a new epoch with the same E
lower bits is introduced.

Let `S` be the number of bits required to encode a member index in the group,
i.e., the smallest value such that `group_size` < (1 << S)`.  The sender index
is encoded in the `S` bits above the epoch.  The remaining `64 - S - E` bits of
the KID value are a `context` value chosen by the sender (context value `0` will
produce the shortest encoded KID).

~~~~~ pseudocode
KID = (context << (S + E)) + (sender_index << E) + (epoch % (1 << E))
~~~~~

Once an SFrame stack has been provisioned with the `sframe_epoch_secret` for an
epoch, it can compute the required KID values on demand (as well as the
resulting SFrame keys/nonces derived from the `base_key` and KID), as it needs
to encrypt or decrypt for a given member.

# Media Considerations

## Selective Forwarding Units

Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) (e.g., those described in {{Section 3.7 of ?RFC7667}})
receive the media streams from each participant and select which ones should be
forwarded to each of the other participants.  There are several approaches about
how to do this stream selection but in general, in order to do so, the SFU needs
to access metadata associated to each frame and modify the RTP information of
the incoming packets when they are transmitted to the received participants.

This section describes how this normal SFU modes of operation interacts with the
E2EE provided by SFrame

### LastN and RTP stream reuse

The SFU may choose to send only a certain number of streams based on the voice
activity of the participants. To avoid the overhead involved in establishing new
transport streams, the SFU may decide to reuse previously existing streams or
even pre-allocate a predefined number of streams and choose in each moment in
time which participant media will be sent through it.

This means that in the same transport-level stream (e.g., an RTP stream defined
by either SSRC or MID) may carry media from different streams of different
participants. As different keys are used by each participant for encoding their
media, the receiver will be able to verify which is the sender of the media
coming within the RTP stream at any given point in time, preventing the SFU
trying to impersonate any of the participants with another participant's media.

Note that in order to prevent impersonation by a malicious participant (not the
SFU), a mechanism based on digital signature would be required. SFrame does not
protect against such attacks.

### Simulcast

When using simulcast, the same input image will produce N different encoded
frames (one per simulcast layer) which would be processed independently by the
frame encryptor and assigned an unique counter for each.

### SVC

In both temporal and spatial scalability, the SFU may choose to drop layers in
order to match a certain bitrate or forward specific media sizes or frames per
second. In order to support it, the sender MUST encode each spatial layer of a
given picture in a different frame. That is, an RTP frame may contain more than
one SFrame encrypted frame with an incrementing frame counter.

## Video Key Frames

Forward Security and Post-Compromise Security require that the E2EE keys (base keys)
are updated any time a participant joins or leaves the call.

The key exchange happens asynchronously and on a different path than the SFU signaling
and media. So it may happen that when a new participant joins the call and the
SFU side requests a key frame, the sender generates the e2ee encrypted frame
with a key not known by the receiver, so it will be discarded. When the sender
updates his sending key with the new key, it will send it in a non-key frame, so
the receiver will be able to decrypt it, but not decode it.

Receiver will re-request an key frame then, but due to sender and SFU policies,
that new key frame could take some time to be generated.

If the sender sends a key frame when the new e2ee key is in use, the time
required for the new participant to display the video is minimized.

## Partial Decoding

Some codes support partial decoding, where it can decrypt individual packets
without waiting for the full frame to arrive, with SFrame this won't be possible
because the decoder will not access the packets until the entire frame has
arrived and was decrypted.

# Security Considerations

## No Header Confidentiality

SFrame provides integrity protection to the SFrame Header (the key ID and
counter values), but does not provide confidentiality protection.  Parties that
can observe the SFrame header may learn, for example, which parties are sending
SFrame payloads (from KID values) and at what rates (from CTR values).  In cases
where SFrame is used for end-to-end security on top of hop-by-hop protections
(e.g., running over SRTP as described in {{sframe-over-rtp}}), the hop-by-hop security
mechanisms provide confidentiality protection of the SFrame header between hops.

## No Per-Sender Authentication

SFrame does not provide per-sender authentication of media data.  Any sender in
a session can send media that will be associated with any other sender.  This is
because SFrame uses symmetric encryption to protect media data, so that any
receiver also has the keys required to encrypt packets for the sender.

## Key Management

Key exchange mechanism is out of scope of this document, however every client
SHOULD change their keys when new clients joins or leaves the call for forward
secrecy and post compromise security.

## Authentication tag length

The cipher suites defined in this draft use short authentication tags for
encryption, however it can easily support other ciphers with full authentication
tag if the short ones are deemed insecure.

## Replay

The handling of replay is out of the scope of this document. However, senders
MUST reject requests to encrypt multiple times with the same key and nonce,
since several AEAD algorithms fail badly in such cases (see, e.g., {{Section 5.1.1 of RFC5116}}).

## Risks due to Short Tags

The SFrame ciphersuites based on AES-CTR allow for the use of short
authentication tags, which bring a higher risk that an attacker will be
able to cause an SFrame receiver to accept an SFrame ciphertext of the
attacker's choosing.

Assuming that the authentication properties of the ciphersuite are robust, the
only attack that an attacker can mount is an attempt to find an acceptable
(ciphertext, tag) combination through brute force.  Such a brute-force attack
will have an expected sucess rate of the following form:

```
attacker_success_rate = attempts_per_second / 2^(8*Nt)
```

For example, a gigabit ethernet connection is able to transmit roughly 2^20
packets per second.  If an attacker saturated such a link with guesses against a
32-bit authentication tag (`Nt=4`), then the attacker would succeed on average
roughly once every 2^12 seconds, or about once an hour.

In a typical SFrame usage in a real-time media application, there are a few
approaches to mitigating this risk:

* Receivers only accept SFrame ciphertexts over HBH-secure channels (e.g., SRTP
  security associations or QUIC connections).  So only an entity that is part of
  such a channel can mount the above attack.

* The expected packet rate for a media stream is very predictable (and typically
  far lower than the above example).  On the one hand, attacks at this rate will
  succeed even less often than the high-rate attack described above.  On the
  other hand, the application may use an elevated packet arrival rate as a
  signal of a brute-force attack.  This latter approach is common in other
  settings, e.g., mitigating brute-force attacks on passwords.

* Media applications typically do not provide feedback to media senders as to
  which media packets failed to decrypt.  When media quality feedback
  mechanisms are used, decryption failures will typically appear as packet
  losses, but only at an aggregate level.

* Anti-replay mechanisms (see {{replay}}) prevent the attacker from re-using
  valid ciphertexts (either observed or guessed by the attacker).  A receiver
  applying anti-replay controls will only accept one valid plaintext per CTR
  value.  Since the CTR value is covered by SFrame authentication, an attacker
  has to do a fresh search for a valid tag for every forged ciphertext, even if
  the encrypted content is unchanged.  In other words, when the above brute
  force attack succeeds, it only allows the attacker to send a single SFrame
  ciphertext; the ciphertext cannot be reused because either it will have the
  same CTR value and be discarded as a replay, or else it will have a different
  CTR value its tag will no longer be valid.

Nonetheless, without these mitigations, an application that makes use of short
tags will be at heightened risk of forgery attacks.  In many cases, it is
simpler to use full-size tags and tolerate slightly higher bandwidth usage
rather than add the additional defenses necessary to safely use short tags.

# IANA Considerations

This document requests the creation of the following new IANA registries:

# Application Responsibilities

To use SFrame, an application needs to define the inputs to the SFrame
encryption and decryption operations, and how SFrame ciphertexts are delivered
from sender to receiver (including any fragmentation and reassembly).  In this
section, we lay out additional requirements that an integration must meet in
order for SFrame to operate securely.

## Header Value Uniqueness

Applications MUST ensure that each (KID, CTR) combination is used for exactly
one SFrame encryption operation. Typically this is done by assigning each sender a KID
or set of KIDs, then having each sender use the CTR field as a monotonic counter,
incrementing for each plaintext that is encrypted. Note that in addition to its
simplicity, this scheme minimizes overhead by keeping CTR values as small as
possible.

## Key Management Framework

It is up to the application to provision SFrame with a mapping of KID values to
`base_key` values and the resulting keys and salts.  More importantly, the
application specifies which KID values are used for which purposes (e.g., by
which senders).  An application's KID assignment strategy MUST be structured to
assure the non-reuse properties discussed in {{header-value-uniqueness}}.

It is also up to the application to define a rotation schedule for keys.  For
example, one application might have an ephemeral group for every call and keep
rotating keys when end points join or leave the call, while another application
could have a persistent group that can be used for multiple calls and simply
derives ephemeral symmetric keys for a specific call.

It should be noted that KID values are not encrypted by SFrame, and are thus
visible to any application-layer intermediaries that might handle an SFrame
ciphertext.  If there are application semantics included in KID values, then
this information would be exposed to intermediaries.  For example, in the scheme
of {{sender-keys}}, the number of ratchet steps per sender is exposed, and in
the scheme of {{mls}}, the number of epochs and the MLS sender ID of the SFrame
sender are exposed.

## Anti-Replay

It is the responsibility of the application to handle anti-replay. Replay by network
attackers is assumed to be prevented by network-layer facilities (e.g., TLS, SRTP).
As mentioned in {{replay}}, senders MUST reject requests to encrypt multiple times
with the same key and nonce.

It is not mandatory to implement anti-replay on the receiver side. Receivers MAY
apply time or counter based anti-replay mitigations.

## Metadata

The `metadata` input to SFrame operations is pure application-specified data. As
such, it is up to the application to define what information should go in the
`metadata` input and ensure that it is provided to the encryption and decryption
functions at the appropriate points.  A receiver MUST NOT use SFrame-authenticated
metadata until after the SFrame decrypt function has authenticated it, unless
the purpose of such usage is to prepare an SFrame ciphertext for SFrame
decryption.  Essentially, metadata may be used "upstream of SFrame" in a
processing pipeline, but only to prepare for SFrame decryption.

For example, consider an application where SFrame is used to encrypt audio
frames that are sent over SRTP, with some application data included in the RTP
header extension. Suppose the application also includes this application data in
the SFrame metadata, so that the SFU is allowed to read, but not modify the
application data.  A receiver can use the application data in the RTP header
extension as part of the standard SRTP decryption process, since this is
required to recover the SFrame ciphertext carried in the SRTP payload.  However,
the receiver MUST NOT use the application data for other purposes before SFrame
decryption has authenticated the application data.

# Example API

**This section is not normative.**

This section describes a notional API that an SFrame implementation might
expose.  The core concept is an "SFrame context", within which KID values are
meaningful.  In the key management scheme described in {{sender-keys}}, each
sender has a different context; in the scheme described in {{mls}}, all senders
share the same context.

An SFrame context stores mappings from KID values to "key contexts", which are
different depending on whether the KID is to be used for sending or receiving
(an SFrame key should never be used for both operations).  A key context tracks
the key and salt associated to the KID, and the current CTR value.  A key
context to be used for sending also tracks the next CTR value to be used.

The primary operations on an SFrame context are as follows:

* **Create an SFrame context:** The context is initialized with a ciphersuite and
  no KID mappings.
* **Adding a key for sending:** The key and salt are derived from the base key, and
  used to initialize a send context, together with a zero counter value.
* **Adding a key for receiving:** The key and salt are derived from the base key, and
  used to initialize a send context.
* **Encrypt a plaintext:** Encrypt a given plaintext using the key for a given KID,
  including the specified metadata.
* **Decrypt an SFrame ciphertext:** Decrypt an SFrame ciphertext with the KID
  and CTR values specified in the SFrame Header, and the provided metadata.

{{rust-api}} shows an example of the types of structures and methods that could
be used to create an SFrame API in Rust.

# Overhead Analysis

Any use of SFrame will impose overhead in terms of the amount of bandwidth
necessary to transmit a given media stream.  Exactly how much overhead will be added
depends on several factors:

* How many senders are involved in a conference (length of KID)
* How long the conference has been going on (length of CTR)
* The cipher suite in use (length of authentication tag)
* Whether SFrame is used to encrypt packets, whole frames, or some other unit

Overall, the overhead rate in kilobits per second can be estimated as:

```
OverheadKbps = (1 + |CTR| + |KID| + |TAG|) * 8 * CTPerSecond / 1024
```

Here the constant value `1` reflects the fixed SFrame header; `|CTR|` and
`|KID|` reflect the lengths of those fields; `|TAG|` reflects the cipher
overhead; and `CTPerSecond` reflects the number of SFrame ciphertexts
sent per second (e.g., packets or frames per second).

In the remainder of this secton, we compute overhead estimates for a collection
of common scenarios.

## Assumptions

In the below calculations, we make conservative assumptions about SFrame
overhead, so that the overhead amounts we compute here are likely to be an upper
bound on those seen in practice.

| Field           | Bytes | Explanation                                       |
|:----------------|------:|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed header    | 1     | Fixed                                             |
| Key ID (KID)    | 2     | >255 senders; or MLS epoch (E=4) and >16 senders  |
| Counter (CTR)   | 3     | More than 24 hours of media in common cases       |
| Cipher overhead | 16    | Full GCM tag (longest defined here)               |

In total, then, we assume that each SFrame encryption will add 22 bytes of
overhead.

We consider two scenarios, applying SFrame per-frame and per-packet.  In each
scenario, we compute the SFrame overhead in absolute terms (Kbps) and as a
percentage of the base bandwidth.

## Audio

In audio streams, there is typically a one-to-one relationship between frames
and packets, so the overhead is the same whether one uses SFrame at a per-packet
or per-frame level.

The below table considers three scenarios, based on recommended configurations
of the Opus codec {{?RFC6716}}:

* Narrow-band speech: 120ms packets, 8Kbps
* Full-band speech: 20ms packets, 32Kbps
* Full-band stereo music: 10ms packets, 128Kbps

| Scenario                 | fps | Base Kbps | Overhead Kbps | Overhead % |
|:-------------------------|:---:|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| NB speech, 120ms packets | 8.3 |         8 |           1.4 |      17.9% |
| FB speech, 20ms packets  |  50 |        32 |           8.6 |      26.9% |
| FB stereo, 10ms packets  | 100 |       128 |          17.2 |      13.4% |
{: #audio-overhead title="SFrame overhead for audio streams" }

## Video

Video frames can be larger than an MTU and thus are commonly split across
multiple frames.  {{video-overhead-per-frame}} and {{video-overhead-per-packet}}
show the estimated overhead of encrypting a video stream, where SFrame is
applied per-frame and per-packet, respectively.  The choices of resolution,
frames per second, and bandwidth are chosen to roughly reflect the capabilities of
modern video codecs across a range from very low to very high quality.

| Scenario    | fps | Base Kbps | Overhead Kbps | Overhead % |
|:------------|:---:|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| 426 x 240   | 7.5 |        45 |           1.3 |       2.9% |
| 640 x 360   |  15 |       200 |           2.6 |       1.3% |
| 640 x 360   |  30 |       400 |           5.2 |       1.3% |
| 1280 x 720  |  30 |      1500 |           5.2 |       0.3% |
| 1920 x 1080 |  60 |      7200 |          10.3 |       0.1% |
{: #video-overhead-per-frame title="SFrame overhead for a video stream encrypted per-frame" }

| Scenario    | fps | pps | Base Kbps | Overhead Kbps | Overhead % |
|:------------|:---:|:---:|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| 426 x 240   | 7.5 | 7.5 |        45 |           1.3 |       2.9% |
| 640 x 360   |  15 |  30 |       200 |           5.2 |       2.6% |
| 640 x 360   |  30 |  60 |       400 |          10.3 |       2.6% |
| 1280 x 720  |  30 | 180 |      1500 |          30.9 |       2.1% |
| 1920 x 1080 |  60 | 780 |      7200 |         134.1 |       1.9% |
{: #video-overhead-per-packet title="SFrame overhead for a video stream encrypted per-packet" }

In the per-frame case, the SFrame percentage overhead approaches zero as the
quality of the video goes up, since bandwidth is driven more by picture size
than frame rate.  In the per-packet case, the SFrame percentage overhead
approaches the ratio between the SFrame overhead per packet and the MTU (here 22
bytes of SFrame overhead divided by an assumed 1200-byte MTU, or about 1.8%).

## Conferences

Real conferences usually involve several audio and video streams.  The overhead
of SFrame in such a conference is the aggregate of the overhead over all the
individual streams.  Thus, while SFrame incurs a large percentage overhead on an
audio stream, if the conference also involves a video stream, then the audio
overhead is likely negligible relative to the overall bandwidth of the
conference.

For example, {{conference-overhead}} shows the overhead estimates for a two
person conference where one person is sending low-quality media and the other
sending high-quality.  (And we assume that SFrame is applied per-frame.)  The
video streams dominate the bandwidth at the SFU, so the total bandwidth overhead
is only around 1%.

| Stream                 | Base Kbps | Overhead Kbps | Overhead % |
|:-----------------------|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Participant 1 audio    |         8 |           1.4 |      17.9% |
| Participant 1 video    |        45 |           1.3 |       2.9% |
| Participant 2 audio    |        32 |           9   |      26.9% |
| Participant 2 video    |      1500 |           5   |       0.3% |
| Total at SFU           |      1585 |          16.5 |       1.0% |

## SFrame over RTP

SFrame is a generic encapsulation format, but many of the applications in which
it is likely to be integrated are based on RTP.  This section discusses how an
integration between SFrame and RTP could be done, and some of the challenges
that would need to be overcome.

As discussed in {{application-context}}, there are two natural patterns for
integrating SFrame into an application: applying SFrame per-frame or per-packet.
In RTP-based applications, applying SFrame per-packet means that the payload of
each RTP packet will be an SFrame ciphertext, starting with an SFrame Header, as
shown in {{sframe-packet}}.  Applying SFrame per-frame means that different
RTP payloads will have different formats: The first payload of a frame will
contain the SFrame headers, and subsequent payloads will contain further chunks
of the ciphertext, as shown in {{sframe-multi-packet}}.

In order for these media payloads to be properly interpreted by receivers,
receivers will need to be configured to know which of the above schemes the
sender has  applied to a given sequence of RTP packets. SFrame does not provide
a mechanism for distributing this configuration information. In applications
that use SDP for negotiating RTP media streams {{?RFC4566}}, an appropriate
extension to SDP could provide this function.

Applying SFrame per-frame also requires that packetization and depacketization
be done in a generic manner that does not depend on the media content of the
packets, since the content being packetized / depacketized will be opaque
ciphertext (except for the SFrame header).  In order for such a generic
packetization scheme to work interoperably one would have to be defined, e.g.,
as proposed in {{?I-D.codec-agnostic-rtp-payload-format}}.

# Test Vectors

This section provides a set of test vectors that implementations can use to
verify that they correctly implement SFrame encryption and decryption.  In
addition to test vectors for the overall process of SFrame
encryption/decryption, we also provide test vectors for header
encoding/decoding, and for AEAD encryption/decryption using the AES-CTR
construction defined in {{aes-ctr-with-sha2}}.

All values are either numeric or byte strings.  Numeric values are represented
as hex values, prefixed with `0x`.  Byte strings are represented in hex
encoding.

Line breaks and whitespace within values are inserted to conform to the width
requirements of the RFC format.  They should be removed before use.

These test vectors are also available in JSON format at {{TestVectors}}.  In the
JSON test vectors, numeric values are JSON numbers and byte string values are
JSON strings containing the hex encoding of the byte strings.

## Header encoding/decoding

For each case, we provide:

* `kid`: A KID value
* `ctr`: A CTR value
* `header`: An encoded SFrame header

An implementation should verify that:

* Encoding a header with the KID and CTR results in the provided header value
* Decoding the provided header value results in the provided KID and CTR values

{::include test-vectors/header.md}


## AEAD encryption/decryption using AES-CTR and HMAC

For each case, we provide:

* `cipher_suite`: The index of the cipher suite in use (see
  {{sframe-cipher-suites}})
* `key`: The `key` input to encryption/decryption
* `enc_key`: The encryption subkey produced by the `derive_subkeys()` algorithm
* `auth_key`: The encryption subkey produced by the `derive_subkeys()` algorithm
* `nonce`: The `nonce` input to encryption/decryption
* `aad`: The `aad` input to encryption/decryption
* `pt`: The plaintext
* `ct`: The ciphertext

An implementation should verify that the following are true, where
`AEAD.Encrypt` and `AEAD.Decrypt` are as defined in {{aes-ctr-with-sha2}}:

* `AEAD.Encrypt(key, nonce, aad, pt) == ct`
* `AEAD.Decrypt(key, nonce, aad, ct) == pt`

The other values in the test vector are intermediate values provided to
facilitate debugging of test failures.

{::include test-vectors/aes-ctr-hmac.md}

## SFrame encryption/decryption

For each case, we provide:

* `cipher_suite`: The index of the cipher suite in use (see
  {{sframe-cipher-suites}})
* `kid`: A KID value
* `ctr`: A CTR value
* `base_key`: The `base_key` input to the `derive_key_salt` algorithm
* `sframe_key_label`: The label used to derive `sframe_key` in the `derive_key_salt` algorithm
* `sframe_salt_label`: The label used to derive `sframe_salt` in the `derive_key_salt` algorithm
* `sframe_secret`: The `sframe_secret` variable in the `derive_key_salt` algorithm
* `sframe_key`: The `sframe_key` value produced by the `derive_key_salt` algorithm
* `sframe_salt`: The `sframe_salt` value produced by the `derive_key_salt` algorithm
* `metadata`: The `metadata` input to the SFrame `encrypt` algorithm
* `pt`: The plaintext
* `ct`: The SFrame ciphertext

An implementation should verify that the following are true, where
`encrypt` and `decrypt` are as defined in {{encryption-schema}}, using an SFrame
context initialized with `base_key` assigned to `kid`:

* `encrypt(ctr, kid, metadata, plaintext) == ct`
* `decrypt(metadata, ct) == pt`

The other values in the test vector are intermediate values provided to
facilitate debugging of test failures.
